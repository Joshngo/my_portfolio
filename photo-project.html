                <p>This project is a desktop application that was built to help photographers manage their
                    photos and sales with an interface that is clean and easy to navigate. The user will have 
                    the ability to upload photos, create albums, and upload invoices to visually track their sales.

                <p style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: This was a project for a class that focused on proper design on the UI of applications, thus some of our ideas portrayed in the application are centered more around design and how it looks, 
                    and was not a requirement that all of the functionality was implemented. The core feature of uploading photos is functional in the application, but the sales management part we assumed to function
                    properly if built with full functionality. If parts of the application look odd or unfinished, it may be because we expected the user to see something similar or assumed to have a certain functionality to the ideas we portray for that certain aspect of the project.
                </p>
                <img class="feature-img" src="images/photoManager/login.png">

                <p>This application was a collaborative project I built with a team. The main idea was to develop a photo management application where photographers (novice or professional)
                    could keep their photos for easy access. In addition, more professional users can keep track of their business sales by uploading their sales records and be met with
                    a visual representation of their data.
                </p>

                <p>When the user logs in, they will see a dashboard with different features of the applications presented to them. They can check their photo library
                    to manage their work and albums, check their sales charts and upload invoices, and upload photos by clicking on the corresponding buttons on the application.
                </p>
                <img class="feature-img" src="images/photoManager/dashboard.png">
                
                <p>The upload photo section of the application will allow the user to upload photos from their file explorer to their gallery.</p>
                <img class="feature-img" src="images/photoManager/import.png">

                <p>If the user goes to their photo library, they can manage their albums and look at their portfolio, categorizing them into a digital album space. Here they can add/delete/edit their photos
                    and put them up for sale if they run a business. For organization, they can create albums where the user can add or delete photos they wish, as well as price them if they wish.
                </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/photoManager/edit-album.png">

                <p>In the sales chart section of the application, the user will be able to see a graph that shows their sales trend over the course of a few days, and ideally be able to
                    view their data with different types of visuals of their choice. These graphs will ideally update as they upload their invoices and sales records. They can delete
                    invoices as they wish, and even download a template of an invoice supplied by the application.

            <h2>Skills I learned</h2>

        <div class="proj-description-container">

            <div class="description-wrapper">

                <p>Skills I learned from this project include:</p>
                <div class="list-wrapper">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio</li>
                        <li>C# and UI Design</li>
                        <li>Design methods</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The biggest part of this project was learning how to design a clean UI with easy navigation. The course for this project
                    taught me skills and techniques to underestand the target audience and develop a system that is easy for our target to use. 
                    Overall, I learned that a proper UI and easy to read front-end is just as important as the functionality behind it.
                </p>

                <p>I think the project was overall successful, however after finishing the course, there are a few places I would improve it, such
                    as the scalability of the photos in the portfolio, expanding the theme to popups and alerts, and of course implementing proper functionality within the system.
