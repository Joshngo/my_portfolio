                <p>This was a database project I built with a team, which centered around the idea of keeping track of store inventory, employee data
                    and other useful information that is important for a store system.

                <p>To access the database and populate its tables, we used SQL, creating an SQL file an populating it with starting values.
                    Once initialized, we imported it to a a web server program XAMPP and PHPmyAdmin to make API calls to and from the database. 
                    Once the database in PHPmyAdmin had the SQL file imported, we could use that interface to add and delete relations from tables
                    using SQL queries.
                </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/inventoryTracker/phpmyadmin.png">

                <p>The backend was all built using PHP, all of the different types of operations being handled by this language. To make calls and queries easier,
                    we created a simple front end interface using HTML and CSS to test API calls from a different interface than the PHPmyAdmin method.
                </p>

                <p>The database keeps track of several parts of a store system, including inventory, products on display, deliver schedules and employee data.
                    The user of the interface would be able to update the stock of items on shelves, check data of each item, and modify items as they need.
                    Similarily, they can also do the same for employees, adding and deleting them or viewing data of the current employees. The schedule part of
                    the system is also similar, where the user can create, delete or update their deliver schedules.

            <div class="description-wrapper">
                <p>The skills I've learned from this project include:</p>
                <div class="list-wrapper">
                    <ul>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>SQL and API Calls</li>
                        <li>PHPmyAdmin and Database operations</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                    <p>This was my first project using SQL to make queries and populate the database, and it
                        was a little bit of a challenge setting it up with XAMPP and PHPmyAdmin. It was a big 
                        learning experience to see how all the database operations work and all the different SQL
                        methods to manage the system.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>There was a lot of coding done in PHP, which was also a challenge for me since I was unfamiliar
                        with the language. Overall, the PHP files were built quite well, as most of the database front editing
                        calls worked properly. If I could improve the project, I would add more restraints on some of the columns
                        for each table, and improve some of the styling. The biggest skills I've learned from this project
                        were primarily setting up the database and making queries, but it could be very much improved for a store inventory
                        use case scenario for some of the data.
