                <p>This project is a web application I built that allows users to chat with one another. It was an individual
                    project I built which utilizes sockets and other technologies to send responses to its end users, in this case,
                    chat messages sent by other people in the chatroom.

                <p>This project is a web application that utilizes socket technology to send requests and responses
                    from a sender and a receiver. I utilized this concept to allow end users to send and receive the 
                    sockets in the form of messages.
                </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/chatroom/chatroom-1.png">

                <p>Each time a user sends a message, it creates a socket from that user containing that message and 
                    sends that message to the users in the chatroom, who will receive this said message. Messages will
                    have other data sent along with it, such as who sent the message (The user is prompted to enter their
                    name before their join the chatroom), the time it was received, etc.
                </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/chatroom/chatroom-2.png">

                <p>A neat fun feature included is being able to change the color of your name, using the "/changecolor" prefix 
                    paired with a hexcode to change your name to any color. Other users will see this color when you send a message.

                <p>
                    In addition to this, the user can also use /changename to change their nickname as well.

                    <p>Building the front end was done using HTML and CSS, and integrating concepts such as Flex and Flexbox style
                        formatting. This was my first project using flex, and I've learned how to utilize it to make my webpage
                        responsive for devices with varying sizes.

                    <p>The backend was all built on JavaScript, and using a socket library to be able to implement the message
                        sending with ease. It was also my first time using JavaScript, which introduced me to the numerous libraries available
                        supported by JavaScript.
