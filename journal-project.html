                <p>This project was a collaborative project done with three other peers, in which we developed an application
                    that provides easy submission of papers for researchers and paper feedback from editors and reviewers. Its target audience
                    is meant for universities, namely their researchers and journal writers.

            <h2>Technologies and features</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="proj-description-container">
            <div class="description-wrapper">

                <p>This project was built to help researchers and journal writers have system to submit their papers to their editors
                    for review and feedback. Reviewers would be able to review these submissions and use the system to easily send feedback
                    to the writers conveniently. Editors would be able to send edits and feedback on the content of the paper.
                </p>

                <p>Because our application was designed to primarily be used by universities, it was important that the application kept
                    track of data of submission and the types of users involved with submissions. This led us to build account and login
                    functionality, so that submissions are kept track of per user, and allow users to easily see what editors and reviewers are available
                    and who responded on papers.
                </p>

                <p>For managing of users within the system, we granted access to adminstrative controls to an assumed administrator. This 
                    administrator will have a different dashboard compared to the other users, and will be able to to manage the users of the system. (Add user, delete users, etc.)
                    Data of users is tracked by a JSON file with all administrative properties of each user.
                </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/journalEditor/admin.png">

                <p>Researchers who are submitting their papers will see a dashboard of the papers they have submitted, and the status of their submissions once they log in. Here, they can submit new papers, or resubmit
                    a paper if they wish. They will be able to nominate a reviewer they wish for their submission. If resubmitting, they must choose a paper that has previously
                    been submitted.
                </p>

                <p>Reviewers will be able to see papers they have been prompted to review in their dashboard once they log in. They'll be able to select the papesr, download them and then
                    send a message back to the researcher who had submit their paper to them.

                <p>Editors will be met with a similar dashboard to the reviewer, where they can select papers to edit and give feedback to the submissions. They will also have the ability to set the status
                    of the papers to let the researchers know if they still need to edit it or it has been finished review.

            <div class="description-wrapper">
                <p>The skills I learned from this project include:</p>

                <div class="list-wrapper">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Java and Eclipse IDE</li>
                        <li>Maven and Vaadin framework</li>
                        <li>SCRUM Methodology</li>
                        <li>Trello for progress reports and planning</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Because the project was built to be a web based application, our team decided to use what the Vaadin web framework
                    offered for front end development, as well as using CSS to style the application according to our plans.
                </p>
                
                <p>The backend was created in Java, using Maven tools to manage the project and assist in running it. During this 
                    project the editor I used was Eclipse, a Java IDE for development.
                </p>

                <p>During development, the team and I followed Scrum procedure to develop the application, participating in proper 
                    sprints and team meetings. Our planning process involved design user case scenarios, UML Class diagrams, Data flow diagrams
                    and several other techniques to help develop the application.
                </p>
